# 作业
## 1、Bubble Sort the list: 33, 56, 17, 8, 95, 22。Make sure the final result is from small to large.Write out the list after the 2nd pass. (10 points) 

## answer：
    list={33,56,17,8,95,22}     
    FOR i from 0 to length-1 DO      
        IF [i]>[i+1] THEN     
            swap(i,i+1)         
        END IF      
    END FOR         

## 2、Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. Design an algorithm to insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with value 50,67,99.

    list={60，65，75，80，90，95}        
    input={50,67,99}     
    FOR i from length-1 to 0       
        IF [i-1]<input && input<[i]           
            swap from [i] to length-1       
            [i]=input        
        END IF            
        IF input<[0]         
            swap form[1] to [length-1]      
            END FOR              
            [0]=input           
        END IF          
        IF input>[length-1]      
           [length]=input       
        END IF       
    END FOR        
    思考：这样易于分类，减少计算次数     

## 3、 What is the state of the stack after the following sequence of Push and Pop operations?
    Form smallest to biggest.
